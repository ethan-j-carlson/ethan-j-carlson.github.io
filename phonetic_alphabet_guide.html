                This page serves as an introduction to interpreting the symbols
                of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).<br><br>
                The IPA is the most widely used phonetic writing system in the 
                fields of phonology, phonetics, and linguistics. Its
                goal is to allow for one universal method for the phonetic
                transcription of natural language, avoiding the idiosyncrasies
                of how each natural alphabet represents the pronunciation of
                its words. It is mostly derived from the Latin alphabet, with
                influence from the Greek alphabet as well.<br><br>
                Things that will be covered here are what defines each sound,
                and how to use that information to determine how to make the
                sound.<br><br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Phonetics">
                    Wikipedia offers a great series on phonetics.

            <h2 id="place_of_articulation">Place of Articulation</h2>
            <p>
                Consonants are determined primarily by two things: the <em>place of
                articulation</em> and <em>manner of articulation</em><br><br>
                The place of articulation is where friction is made in the vocal
                tract for a given sound. Usually, this is determined by the
                tongue, and where it makes contact with the rest of the mouth.
                However, there are places of articulation that act independently
                of the tongue.<br><br>
                There are four major categories that the places of articulation
                are grouped into based on their phonetic similarities and
                their location. These categories usually have one or more sounds
                that overlap between two categories:

                        consonants, which are made directly behind the
                        alveolar ridge, and includes retroflex, palatoalveolar and

                        pharyngeal, epiglottal and glottal consonants. Many also 
                        put uvular sounds in this category.

                There are also common sounds which use the lips alongside
                a dorsal place of articulation. These include labio-velar
                sounds that use the soft palate/velum and the lips, and
                labio-palatal sounds that use the hard palate and lips

                articulation, including examples of sounds in a major language.

                        to various degrees. The glottis is
                        also responsible for voicing.

            <h2 id="manner_of_articulation">Manner of Articulation</h2>
            <p>
                Manner of articulation is the other primary factor determining
                how consonants are made. This is often determined by how close
                an articulator (usually the tongue) to the place of articulation.
                However, there are other more complicated parts that go into 
                articulation, which will be discussed.
                For consonants, there are 4 primary groups of articulations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Stops</em> are made by blocking air from exiting the mouth
                    completely, building up pressure and then releasing.
                    The most simple category of stops are called <em>plosives</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Fricatives</em> are made by touching the tongue to the
                    place of articulation, but weakly enough to let air pass.
                    This usually results in a hiss or breathy sound.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Trills</em> are made by bringing the tip of the tongue to
                    the place of articulation and relaxing it, allowing breath
                    to make the tongue vibrate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Approximants</em> are made by bringing the tongue close to
                    the place of articulation without touching it. These sounds
                    are close to vowels due to the similarly lower friction.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Stops and fricatives are in a superclass called obstruents, where
                the sound is formed by significantly blocking airflow
                Within these categories, there are subtypes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Nasals</em> are a variety of stops that allow air to flow
                    through the nose but not the mouth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Implosives</em> are a variety of stops where the glottis
                    moves down as air is blown out, partially trapping air as
                    it is being blown out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Ejectives</em> are a variety of stops where the glottis
                    is constricted, blocking airflow. Air is instead pushed out
                    purely with the tongue
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Clicks</em> are a type of obstruent that is close to a stop.
                    Air is trapped between a dorsal point of articulation and
                    a different place in front of it, starting at the hard palate.
                    Clicks can vary by both points of articulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taps/flaps are sounds where the tongue only briefly touches
                    the place of articulation. Taps and flaps are often typed
                    together, but they are distinct by how the tongue moves to and
                    from the place of articulation. To me, taps act more like a
                    short stop, and flaps act more like a single flap of a trill.

                        This wikipedia page is a good starting place to learn more.
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Affricates</em> are sounds that start as a plosive and ends
                    as a fricative. Airflow is stopped, pressure is built, but
                    the air is let out gradually as a fricative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Lateral fricatives</em> are fricatives where the airflow is 
                    split in two, having air go through either side of the
                    tongue, but being blocked through the center. This is usually
                    done by putting the sides of the back of the tongue against
                    the molars while articulating a fricative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Lateral affricates</em> are the same as normal affricates,
                    but the stop is released as a lateral fricative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Lateral approximants</em> are approximants where the
                    airflow is split in two like a lateral fricative, but while
                    an approximant is being made instead of a fricative.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Nearly every place of articulation has a stricture series, where
                the articulator is gradually lowered to produce different
                sounds.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_articulation">
                    Wikipedia has a good page on relative articulation.

            <h2 id="phonation">Voicing and Phonation</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a fun question: what's the difference between P and B?
                They have the same place and manner of articulation, but they
                are definitely for different sounds in English. The answer is
                voicing.<br><br>
                Voicing is done by vibrating the vocal cords. /p/ is voiceless,
                where the vocal cords don't vibrate. /b/ is voiced, where the
                vocal cords do vibrate as the sound is made. You can confirm This
                by feeling your throat as you make /p/ and /b/<br><br>
                Voicing is one of many phonations. Another is called aspiration.
                Aspiration is adding extra breath to a consonant. In English,
                voiceless plosives are aspirated at the beginning of words, and
                not aspirated at the end. It may be hard for English speakers
                to hear the difference, but putting your hand close to your mouth
                as you say "pop" lets you feel the difference between the two.
                Heavily voiced sounds are never aspirated, but one can make breathy
                voiced sounds, where an aspirated sound is partially voiced.
                This is because both airflow and voicing is determined by the
                glottis, the opening between the two vocal cords. Voicing needs
                the vibration of the two vocal cords, while aspiration needs them
                to be open and relaxed. Breathy voicing is essentially a
                compromise between the two. English does not distinguish between
                them, but they can be made by trying to whisper a voiced sound
                such as /b/. On the IPA consonant chart, voiced consonants are put
                to the right of a voiceless consonants.<br><br>
                A vocal fry, formally called creaky voicing, is another form of
                voicing where the vocal cords are compressed more. The
                stereotypical "surfer dude" voice is notable for its use of
                creaky voicing.<br><br>
                Tone is another major type of phonation, that many languages use
                to distinguish sounds, usually vowels. Sounds are distinguished
                in tone by changing the pitch of the sound, either gradually,
                or in quick steps. English uses a gradual tone when questions
                are being asked, specifically the rising tone.
            </p>

            <h2 id="vowel_height">Vowel Height</h2>
            <p>
                When the tongue goes lower than the point of being an approximant,
                sounds enter "vowel space". Tongue <em>height</em> is one of three
                primary factors which determine what vowel is made.<br><br>
                /i/, as in b<strong>ee</strong>, lies at the top of vowel space,
                while /a/ or /ɑ/ as in f<strong>a</strong>ther, lies at the
                bottom. Between the heights of /i/ and /a/ lie sounds such as /ɛ/
                like is b<strong>e</strong>t.
            </p>

            <h2 id="vowel_depth">Vowel Depth</h2>
            <p>
                The <em>depth</em> of a vowel is the second primary factor in
                making a vowel. /i/ as in b<strong>ee</strong> and /u/ as in 
                y<strong>ou</strong>
                are roughly at the same height, but are very different vowels.
                They differ in rounding, but also differ drastically in depth:
                /i/ is a front vowel, and /u/ is a back vowel. There are also
                central vowels, with /ə/ as in <strong>uh</strong> being the
                most common one found in English. Furthermore, there are sounds
                that go between these 3 depths. /ɪ/ as in <strong>i</strong>t
                is near-front, between front and center. /ʊ/ as in c<strong>ou</strong>ld
                is near-back, between center and back.<br><br>
                Above I have described the convention in which the IPA describes
                all vowels, where they are in a 2D space, often represented by
                a vowel trapezoid. However, this is not completely representative
                of how they are truly made. For better details see:<br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Articulation">
                    Wikipedia's section on vowel articulation
                </a><br>

            </p>

            <h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>
            <p>
                As briefly mentioned in the section on vowel depth, vowels also
                differ in <em>rounding</em>. Rounded vowels have the lips more
                closed, while unrounded vowels have the lips more open. /i/ and /u/
                are very unrounded and very unrounded respectively, and thus
                make for good examples in rounding. Every vowel can be rounded or
                unrounded. Many languages have vowel pairs only made distinct
                by their rounded-ness. French is an example of this, having /i/ as
                in Par<strong>i</strong>s, and /y/ as in t<strong>u</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2 id="suprasegmentals">Suprasegmentals</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Suprasegmentals</em> are used to distinguish the length
                and emphasis of a sound, as well as how they transition.<br><br>
                The tie bar is a suprasegmental used primarily to represent
                affricates, such as /t͡ʃ/ as in <strong>ch</strong>air. They are
                also used in biarticulated sounds, where two, non interfering
                consonants are made at the same time<br><br>
                There are many other, primarily determining stress, sound length
                and pauses, which are documented on other pages from this site.
            </p>
            <h2 id="diacritics">Diacritics</h2>
            <p>
                All that was said above is most of what is needed to distinguish
                between the "letters" of the IPA. However, some of what was
                discussed above needs <em>diacritics</em>, also known as accent 
                marks. Many languages need little to no diacritics to broadly
                transcribe, but they are regardless an important facet of the IPA.
                Many languages have sounds, such as nasal vowels, that can
                only be represented with diacritics. Other diacritics are often
                used to be more precise in transcribing specific sounds in a
                language that does not otherwise care about the distinction.
                Because they are a complicated subject, they will be omitted
                here, and they can instead be found elsewhere on the site.
