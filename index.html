            <p>
                <strong><a href="index.html">Quick Phonetics</a></strong>
                is a website which makes researching phonetics easier.
                It provides a quick reference to all of the symbols in the <em>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">
                    International Phonetic Alphabet
                </a> </em> (IPA), and all of the language-neutral information about
                the symbol and its associated sound that one needs to pronounce
                the sound, or to implement it in an application's backend.
            </p>

            <h2>What is phonetics?</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Phonetics</em> is the study of the classification of
                spoken sounds. A sound is classified based both on how its made
                and what it sounds like, with the latter being more important.
                Spoken sound is naturally infinitely variable, but a
                phonetician's job is to simply the sounds into more broadly
                applicable categories, and explain how a sound of that category
                could be mimicked.<br><br>
                <em>Phonology</em>, a closely related field, studies how sounds are
                used in a language, how languages represent them, and how
                they change and affect each other.

            <h2>Why Study the International Phonetic Alphabet?</h2>
            <img src="images/why.png" alt="Thought bubble with the word 'Why'">
            <p>
                Researching or describing the pronunciation of a language can often
                be difficult due to the challenge of describing one language's 
                sounds in the perspective of the other, non-inclusive language.
                The IPA remedies this by providing a standard intermediate between
                languages. Being able to transcribe a language in IPA and be able to
                read it greatly simplifies the ability to convey and teach the sounds
                of a language. Many languages will have some source transcribing
                their words with IPA, or otherwise log which IPA sounds the language
                has and what each letter can represent. Thus, knowing the IPA
                is a very valuable skill in studying language.
                Below is an introductory video to the IPA for English speakers:

            <h2>Why Should Studying Language Become Easier?</h2>
            <img src="images/globe.png" alt="Global map">
            <p>
                Our world is becoming increasingly globalized. Many people move to
                countries that do not share their native language, either for fun
                or for business. Because of this, the number of people who want or need
                to improve their pronunciation of a foreign language is only going up.
                Additionally, apps such as <em>Duolingo</em> have been popularizing
                studying language for fun or for a sense of accomplishment.
